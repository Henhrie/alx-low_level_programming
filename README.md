C Program Learning Journey
----
This GitHub repository showcases my learning process in C programming through weekly assignments. In this repository, you will find a collection of C programs that I have completed as part of my learning journey.

Weekly Assignments
----
Each week, I will be adding a new set of assignments that cover various concepts and topics in C programming. These assignments are designd to enhance my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

Structure of the Repository
----
The repository is structured into weekly directories, with each directory representing a specific week of my learning journey. Inside each weekly directory, you will find the C programs I have completed for that week's assignments. The programs are named appropriately to reflect the concepts they cover.

How to Use the Repository
----
Feel free to explore the weekly directories to see the progression of my learning. You can browse the programs, review the source code, and understand the logic behind each assignment. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Contributions
----
While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning journal, I welcome contributions from the community. If you have an interesting C program or a suggestion for an assignment, please feel free to share it. Let's learn together and grow as programmers.
